# jsdraw
This is a fun project to create a video of [pythagoras tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal)) (a kind of fractal) from scratch.

- /jsdraw.html?cmd=pytha&animate=true
  - draw a rotating pythagoras tree animate using HTML5 canvas. There is a link built to download every single frame
- gen_gif.py
  - combine a bunch of static image to a gif using imageio
- video_to_audio.py
  - extract audio from an existing video
- add_sound_to_gif.py
  - generate a new video with existing gif and audio

Check the final video as medias/pytha.avi

The repository also contains a few other fun small programs.
- /jsdraw.html?cmd=sin
  - draw a pair of twisted rotating sin curves
- /jsdraw.html?cmd=heart
  - draw a blinking heart
- castle_in_the_sky.py
  - play a snippet of [castle in the sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky) theme using moviepy. All the notes are played by playing a sin curve with proper frequency!
- video_to_gif.py 
  - convert video to gif
